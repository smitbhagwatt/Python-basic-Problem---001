CODE:


sentence = "Artifical Intelligence and Machine Learning are future technologies"

#1. Count total number of vowels
vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
vowel_count = sum(1 for ch in sentence if ch in vowels)
print("Total number of vowels:", vowel_count)

#2. Convert the sentence to a list of words and print them
words = sentence.split()
print("List of words:", words)

#3. Find the longest word in the sentnce
longest_word = max(words, key=len)
print("longest word:", longest_word)

#4. Reverse the sentence word-by-word
reversed_sentence = " ".join(reversed(words))
print("Reversed Sentnece: ", reversed_sentence)

#5. Count the number of times letter 'a' or 'A' appears
a_count = sum(1 for ch in sentence if ch.lower() == 'a')
print("number of 'a' or 'A':", a_count)

# 6. Replace "Machine" with "Deep" and print the new sentence
new_sentence = sentence.replace("Machine", "Deep")
print("New sentence:", new_sentence)

#7. Check if the word "Learning" exists in the sentence
exists = "Learning" in words
print("Does 'Learning' exist in the sentence?", exists)
